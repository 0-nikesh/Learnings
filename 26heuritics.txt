
Heuristic:

    A heuristic is a problem-solving strategy or rule of thumb that may not always guarantee an optimal solution 
    but is efficient and often "good enough" for practical purposes. Heuristics are commonly used when an exhaustive 
    search for an optimal solution is not feasible due to the large size or complexity of the problem.

    Examples of heuristics include:

        The nearest neighbor algorithm for the traveling salesman problem.
        The greedy algorithm for the knapsack problem.
        The hill climbing algorithm for optimization problems.

Metaheuristic:

    Metaheuristics are higher-level strategies or frameworks used to design heuristic optimization algorithms.
    They guide the search for solutions in the problem space and are not specific to any particular problem.
    Metaheuristics often employ iterative improvement methods and make use of stochastic (random) processes 
    to explore the solution space efficiently.

    Examples of metaheuristics include:

        Genetic algorithms
        Simulated annealing
        Tabu search
        Ant colony optimization

Example Problem Solvable by Metaheuristic Approach:

    One example of a problem that can be solved using a metaheuristic approach is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). 
    In this classic optimization problem, the task is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly 
    once and returns to the original city. As the number of cities increases, finding the optimal solution becomes 
    increasingly computationally expensive. Metaheuristic algorithms like genetic algorithms and ant colony optimization 
    are commonly used to find near-optimal solutions for large-scale instances of the TSP.

Genetic Algorithm (GA):

    Genetic algorithms are a type of metaheuristic inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics. 
    They mimic the process of evolution by iteratively generating a population of potential solutions to a problem, 
    evaluating their fitness, and applying genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation to produce 
    new candidate solutions.

    The basic steps of a genetic algorithm are as follows:

        Initialization: Create an initial population of individuals (candidate solutions).
        Evaluation: Assess the fitness of each individual in the population based on how well it solves the problem.
        Selection: Choose individuals from the population to act as parents for the next generation, typically based on their fitness (better solutions have a higher chance of being selected).
        Crossover: Create new individuals (offspring) by combining the genetic information of selected parents through crossover operations.
        Mutation: Introduce random changes to the offspring to maintain diversity in the population.
        Replacement: Replace the current population with the new generation of individuals.
        Termination: Repeat the process until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or satisfactory solution is found).
